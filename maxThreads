Each incoming request requires a thread for the duration of that request.
If more simultaneous requests are received than can be handled 
by the currently available request processing threads, additional threads will be
created up to the configured maximum (the value of the maxThreads attribute).
If still more simultaneous requests are received, they are stacked up inside the
server socket created by the Connector, up to the configured
maximum (the value of the acceptCount attribute). Any further
simultaneous requests will receive "connection refused" errors,
until resources are available to process them.
