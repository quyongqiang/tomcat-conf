Each incoming request requires a thread for the duration of that request.
If more simultaneous requests are received than can be handled 
by the currently available request processing threads, additional threads will be
created up to the configured maximum (the value of the maxThreads attribute).
If still more simultaneous requests are received, they are stacked up inside the
server socket created by the Connector, up to the configured
maximum (the value of the acceptCount attribute). Any further
simultaneous requests will receive "connection refused" errors,
until resources are available to process them.

对以上的理解：
每个请求需要一个线程处理，首先使用空闲线程，不够，再创建线程，知道达到maxThreads，然后再多请求就先接收下来，
如果接收的请求达到acceptCount，其他请求就会被拒绝，connection refused.
